| 1 | Forensic Logging, Secure auditing                                                 | This will provide Forensic Logging and Auditing capabilities to Mojaloop Core for Security and Auditing purposes. ( Part-1 Design, PoC): The topic itself will span 2 PIs as its significant, the first part will involve design and limited implementation as PoC or on selected core services (the second PI will standardize and implement it across all of Mojaloop Core) |
| 2 | Performance: PoC learnings implementation  | Improve Scalability and Performance of Mojaloop Core services; depending on the outputs of the Perf/Arch PoC stream which will be presented at the event, a decision needs to be made whether to refactor the core system as a whole or if several items can be cherry picked and used as enhancements to the current codebase. This will need to include various stakeholdersâ€™ inputs and take into consideration how it will impact production systems that are currently live (and how upgrades can/should be handled if we go ahead with this).  |
