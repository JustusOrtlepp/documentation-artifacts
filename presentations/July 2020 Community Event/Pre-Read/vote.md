## Roadmap Topics & Business Value

| S.No   | Title                                                                              | Business Value                                                                                                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Forensic Logging, Secure auditing                                                 | This will provide Forensic Logging and Auditing capabilities to Mojaloop Core for Security and Auditing purposes. ( Part-1 Design, PoC): The topic itself will span 2 PIs as its significant, the first part will involve design and limited implementation as PoC or on selected core services (the second PI will standardize and implement it across all of Mojaloop Core) |
| 2 | Performance: PoC learnings implementation  | Improve Scalability and Performance of Mojaloop Core services; depending on the outputs of the Perf/Arch PoC stream which will be presented at the event, a decision needs to be made whether a) to refactor the core system as a whole or b) if several items can be cherry picked and used as enhancements to the current codebase. This will need to include various stakeholders’ inputs and take into consideration how it will impact production systems that are currently live (and how upgrades can/should be handled if we go ahead with this).  |
| 3 | Ticketing system                                                                   | A proof of Concept for integration with a widely used ticketing system as reference implementation; this is to be integrated with events of interest at various levels of Operation, Administration (such as health of infrastructure, services or hitting thresholds / limits on NDC, etc); Another aspect to this is "Case Management"; however, this will involve 'segregation of data'. Workflows will need consolidation, investigation of information & cascading to other parties. Different teams to be involved with restricted access / permissions  |
| 4 | Portals for Onboarding & Managing DFSPs, etc  | Portal development improvements and documentation to ease the onboarding for new community members and/or DFSPs              |
| 5 | Rules API | Provide a Mojaloop core capability to allow custom rules for processing transfers to be defined and executed efficiently, and to extend this capacity to allow scheme administrators to set up rules for transfers without requiring developer support  |
| 6 | Split Payment Capability (SNAPP)                                                   | Enable a PISP to route payments to multiple recipients in a single request. Support all-or-none payments and variable commission on payments.  |
| 7 | Standardize operations (Admin) API                                                 |   Standardize the Onboarding and Operations API that is used to Onboard FSPs and manage various aspects such as Limits, Endpoints, Contacts, Thresholds, etc.  |
| 8 | Streamline Testing & QA                                                            | Provide relability of testing processes by improving coverage on features, reliability of tests, documentation, cron jobs for regression testing and other QA features.  |
| 9 | ISO 20022 adaptation  | Natively adapt to ISO 20022 to support World Bank initiatives  |
| 10 | Code quality and Security                                                          | Additional development to ensure Mojaloop is of high quality with robust security practices  |
| 11 | Cross Network / Currency (CNP/FXP)                                                 | Develop and demonstrate a Proof of Concept showing how a proxy for a non-Mojaloop networkj could connect to a Mojaloop scheme and allow its subscribing participants to send and receive P2P payments. |
| 12 | Fraud Management                                                                   | Introduce a framework technology to help with the management and prevention of fraud within the system  |
| 13 | Leadership & Community Management | Provide guidance, governance and support for the development of tools, hack-a-thons and communication to community members   |
| 14 | LPS Adapter Enhancements                            | Develop future pilots and/or use cases for the Legacy Payments System (LPS) , ATM, Point of Sale (PoS), etc.  |
| 15 | Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISP)  | Provide a solution for third party Payment Initiation so that it can support PISPs.  |
| 16 | DFSP Operational Tools (Payment Hub EE/Payment Manager)                            | Design and development of tools for enabling DFSPs and integrators supporting them to efficiently connect to Mojaloop and effectively participate in Mojaloop payment systems from a business and technical perspective. This includes tools like Payment Manager from ModusBox and Payment Hub EE from Mifos.                        |
| 17 | Settlement-v2                                                                      |  Extending settlement capabilities to allow schemes to apply their own categories to transfers and to settle on demand by category. Design and implement a flexible and robust way to extend the ways in which schemes can define the content and timing of settlements. Align the internal representation of gross and net settlements. |  
| 18 | Testing toolkit for FSPs, Hubs                                                     |   Support wider adoption and enhance test coverage (for DFSPs, Hubs); provide support to transition existing postman collections |
| 19 | Versioning standards, version maintenance                                          | Provide standards for versioning Mojaloop releases, APIs; Provide enhancements to make it easier for Mojaloop consumers to upgrade to new versions of the platform  |
| 20 | Web Payments (Coil)  | Web-payments with Mobile Money API and Mojaloop  |
| 21 | GSMA Lab  | Enhancements to the GSMA Lab  |
