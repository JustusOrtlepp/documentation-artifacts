Trust Stamp would like to talk to Mojaloop community about their work in helping a bank identify account takeover fraud attempts in the US using face biometrics to reauthenticate, how they use a shared greylist to help a consortium track via greylisting & how the underlying technology protects biometric data at the edge of the network as part of Mastercard's inclusive ID vaccination program. | Business  | Gareth Genner, Emma Lindley                                |
